    <h2>How to Contribute?</h2>
    <p>I have cloned my partner's repository in Git Extensions and found a folder with my name.</p>
    <p>I have modified this file, <strong>index.html</strong>, to assist others in learning Git from scratch.</p>
    <p>After making the necessary changes, I will commit and push my work to my partner's repository on GitHub.</p>
    <p>Once my partner has completed their work, I will review and apply the final changes.</p>
    <p>Finally, I will take a screenshot of the work history in Git Extensions and add it to <strong>E2Contributing.md</strong>.</p>
